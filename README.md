# Convection_linear_regression

## Summary
The Earth's magnetic field is the largest feature of our planet, protecting the atmosphere from harmful solar radiation. The magnetic field is generatedby the complicated flow of liquin iron deep within the Earth's interior. Estimates of the parameters in Earth's core are so extreme that numerical simulations can only run with values orders of magnitude different. We try to bridge the gap between the numerical models and Earth's core by construbting scaling laws which could be extrapolated over many orders of magnitude to Earth's ore values. We use multivariate linear regression to develop powerlaws for the heat and momentum transfer and show that dynamical shifts in their trends are correlated and dcan be used to outline regimes of rotating convection. We find the rapidly rotating regimeswhich may be most consistent with planetary cores and this allows us to target specific parameter models to investigate core dynamics. 

## Parameters 
Three control parameters specify the system of equations to be numerically solved, the Ekman number, $E$, represents the dominance of the Earth's rotation and this number is very small in Earth's core, the Rayleigh number, $Ra$, a measure of how strong the thermal forcing is, and the Prandtkk number, $Pr$ which is the ratio of how fast momentum diffuses relative to thermal diffusion.
$$EE=\dfrac{\nu}{2\Omega h^2}, Ra=\dfrac{\alpha g \Delta T h^3}{\nu \kappa},, Pr=\dfrac{\nu}{\kappa}.$$
